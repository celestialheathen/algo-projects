# We are given two strings, s and goal.
# A shift on s consists of taking string s and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if s = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on s. Return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = 'abcde', goal = 'cdeab'
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: s = 'abcde', goal = 'abced'
# Output: false

def rotate_string(s, goal)
  s.length.times do ||
